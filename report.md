# Reflection on my Intended Design
Upon reflection, I have found that my initial design laid a simplified foundation for the progression of the Monopoly Game. The classes I initially designed were sufficient for the basic functionality of the game and there were no extra classes in my design. The working design presented a 'ConsoleUI' class with enumeration 'Action', which I did not include in my initial design. Naming of the classes was consistent and clear throughout both designs. My initial design had classes primarily through associations, for instance the 'Game' class had an association with the 'Player' and 'Board' classes that therefore with each 'Game' instance was a direct reference of 'Player' and 'Board' Class for its operation. Also the abstract class 'Tile' had subclasses that were 'PropertyTile', 'StartTile', and 'FreeTile', which then would interact with the 'Board' class. The complexity of my design was ensuring that the responsibilities for example movement, property management and user interaction was spread throughout several classes, this way would keep the classes from becoming too complex and would allow for easier debugging and maintenance.

The object diagram for the working design was more detailed than my initial design. It represented the state of a board game with named properties like "Downing Street" and "Seven Sisters Road", and also two dice with values. It also showed a human player named "Boris" with a fund of 300 that was connected to the "Downing Street" property. My initial design however was more abstract and did not include the specific names of the objects, but rather objects with attributes like 'currentRound' and 'currentPlayer', with the usage of the classes like 'Player', 'Dice' and 'PropertyTile' in a instance of 'Game' object. The working design had pointers like 'next' and 'prev' that showed a clearer flow of movement across the board, while in my initial design it showed 'currentPosition' as the link from 'Player' to 'PropertyTile', and then used the relationship between 'Player' and 'Dice' that showed the player who uses the dice to move.

The same was with the working design in the sequence diagram, it contained detailed and specific methods, calls, returns and clearer flow of control between the objects. For instance it showed interactions between the 'Game', 'Boris: HumanPlayer', 'ui: ConsoleUI' etc. My initial design was more abstract and simpler, it showed less interactions but focused on the main steps like rollig the dice, moving the player, passing the tiles and offering to buy a property. The working design had more method calls while my initial design had more interactions without the details of individual methods calls, for example it included 'Prompt Boris to roll dice', roll() move() and so on. The game flow was provided in a more detailed view of one round of the game in the working design, and in my initial design it showed sequence of actions within a turn of the game without going into the details like financial transactions.

I think my initial design was made sufficient enough to cover the fundamental aspects of a Monopoly game. It was not detail enriched like the working design, but it was a good starting point for the progression of the game. The most important thing I learned by designing first was that it is important to have a clear understanding of the potential issues and architectural challenges before starting to coding. Since the UML diagrams acts as a blueprint, it is important to have a clear understanding of the relationships between the classes and the responsibilities of each class. This way it is easier to design a system that is easy to understand, maintain and extend.
